default to using the static xml file, parsing the revision number from
the $Id$

* allow comment only on the static xml

when a comment applies to an earlier revision and cannot be applied to
the current revision, place it (formatted discernibly) at the best
place you can find, stepping up the xpath until you find a place you
can hang it.  i.e.:

 - if sect3.p1.s4 exists, put the note at the end of sect3.p1.s4
 - else if sect3.p1 exists, put the note at the end of sect3.p1
 - else if sect3 exists, etc.

the link will say something like: "see N comments on earlier revisions"

then you'll see the previous revision, with the comments that had been
made at that point (if you want to see newer comments, look at the
newer revision)
