pre-launch:
-html filtering (wtf does this mean)(of of input)
-issue flag customfield; enter id to add to issue

-comments that aren't attached to an issue yet
is-issue:assignedtomycommitte
isUnAssigned

drafter comments go to a drafter queue by default

if you have permission for more than one queue, noteifydiv gives you a
pulldown -- with the private queue selected by default -- to choose
which queue to put it in

there is a washed and an unwashed queue; public queries show both by
defuault, but drafters etc. may see only washed+private or whatever.

Fri: Email submission gateway


Ticket hierarchy:
Group > Issue > Comment
(any can have multiple parents: OK)

Prettify /Ticket/Display.html
Prettify /Search/Results.html
Modify   /Search/Results.rdf with stet/gplv3 specific info
 Below are all just RT queries, need prettifying & features like join-group:
  User comment summary/rss
   Self-associate with group(s)
  Group comment summary/rss
  Issue == Group/Parent
 - external media links (multiple possible, ideally clickable links when
   meaningful)
 - I wish to expand on this comment

license.xml view things:
Query to limit display of comments on license
Show comments on same region before entering
Show only excerpt of comment; js to expand to full comment.

At least demo-able: 
 - Define an issue (parent tkt), associate comments (children) with it.
 - Add child issue to parent(s)

x Long comments (fixed)
formatting paragraph breaks in multi-para comments (currently inlinesmoosh)
fix overlapping comments! (worked at first: currently breaking)

Group leaders see raw feed of comments thru RTish

Intensity highlighting
Multi-colored highlights for visual association of comments with text.

Copyright/licensing notices; any "powered by" ID crap


Okay, so it will never be valid xml to have <span1><span2></span2></span1>.
I need to have a little something that will take

Mary had a little lamb
Mary had a little
         a little 

And make it into
<span1 count="2">Mary had </span1>
<span2 count="3">a little </span2>
<span3 count="1">lamb</span3>



NOT ME:
------
Pages that tell people what to do (with Fontana next week)

Volunteers/training

Some RT and HTML::Mason stuff with Jesse & Dave

TO DISCUSS:
----------
Annoying Squid caching: sometimes updates can't be seen right away
because cached (apparently)

Couldn't get Mason scripts to run outside of /rt/: don't know what I'm doing.

RT running in mod_perl rather than fcgid/speedycgi (free) or fastcgi
(non-free).  Would be nice to get it going with one of the free
possibilities.

filename branding: I feel we shouldn't have a file called "gpl3.xml"
until the license exists; gpl3-draft1 or something.

tell me a path to use instead of /stet/:/comment/

gplv3-draft-1.xml

- ask voyer/russ for email submission help?

-------

POSTLAUNCH
------
allowing users to specify what their comment is about instead of being
done by volunteers.

throttling number of comments

figuring out whether a comment is a responsible comment

in addition to upgrading, users may say that something is spam

remember comment window placement?

DONE:

RT ticket permissions/restrict drafter comments to drafters only:

-__ac_name to __ac
-red box for required

Fri:
 - agreement/rating/"urgency" (numeric, conceivably limitless)
	Indicate agreement (but only once per comment!)


XML-RPC auth (today with baughj)
  - I need a "realm".  This may be my only problem really, but I
couldn't get it back from a GET, POST or DUMP request as I came to
expect I could.
  - good progress, using Frontier::Client

x Don't submit comments as root: make submitters users.

Wed: allow "subject/summary" for tickets

HL <novalis> for comment in comments:
<novalis> for word_index in comment:
<novalis> intensity[word_index] += 1
<orion> novalis: that's so easy.  I'm suspicious of it, but I'll implement it
        :)
<orion> s/\./,/
<novalis> orion: Does it do what you want?
<novalis> orion: I have no idea what your code looks like, so this was just
          the random thing I came up with off the top of my head
<orion> I think so.  I also need to insert the annotation <div>, but it seems
        like I can just do:
<orion> if word_index == count(word_indexes)
<orion> insert div
<orion> so I'll give that a go.  I also need to make sure I'm at the right
        word index, if I'm highlighting "the comment" in the string "the the
        the the comment", but no problem.
<orion> thanks, that's a good solution.

BP Qs:

- get username by user id
- get username of submitter/creator
- fix auth
- why don't my $TicketObj->FromSQL($Query) + LimitFoo work? (or do they?)
- oh my god is the query really that slow?  this could be a huge problem.
- https considerations -- don't really want people to crack Eben's password
  and see his notes
