      <title>0. PREAMBLE</title>

<p id="gsfdl.preamble.p4">
 <sent id="gsfdl.preamble.p1.s1">The biggest shortfall in the free software
world today is not in the software---it is the lack of good free
documentation that we can include with the free software.</sent> <sent
id="gsfdl.preamble.p1.s2">Many of the most important programs do not come
with free reference manuals and free introductory texts.</sent> <sent
id="gsfdl.preamble.p1.s3">Documentation is an essential part of any software
package; when an important free software package does not come with a
free manual and a free tutorial, that is a major gap.</sent> <sent
id="gsfdl.preamble.p1.s4">We have many such gaps today.</sent>
</p>

<p id="gsfdl.preamble.p2">
 <sent id="gsfdl.preamble.p2.s1">How did these gaps arise?</sent> <sent
 id="gsfdl.preamble.p2.s2">Most often because the developers of free software
 do not recognize the need for free documentation.</sent> <sent
 id="gsfdl.preamble.p2.s3">Many times we have heard a free software user
 eagerly describe a manual that he is writing, intended as a
 contribution to the community, only to learn that he had ruined it
 entirely by signing a publication contract to make it
 non-free.</sent>
</p>

<p id="gsfdl.preamble.p3">
 <sent id="gsfdl.preamble.p3.s1">Free documentation, like free software, is a
matter of freedom, not price.</sent> <sent id="gsfdl.preamble.p3.s2">The
problem with the non-free manual is not that publishers charge a price
for printed copies---that in itself is fine.</sent> <sent
id="gsfdl.preamble.p3.s3">The problem is the restrictions on the use of the
manual.</sent> <sent id="gsfdl.preamble.p3.s4">Free manuals are available in
source code form, and give you permission to copy and modify.</sent>
<sent id="gsfdl.preamble.p3.s5">Non-free manuals do not allow this.</sent>
</p>

<p id="gsfdl.preamble.p4">
 <sent id="gsfdl.preamble.p4.s1">The purpose of this License is to make a
manual, textbook, reference work, or other document free in the sense
of freedom.</sent> <sent id="gsfdl.preamble.p4.s2">The criteria of freedom
for a free manual are the same four freedoms that define free
software.</sent> <sent id="gsfdl.preamble.p4.s3">Redistribution (including
the normal kinds of commercial redistribution) must be permitted, so
that the manual, both on-line and on paper, can accompany every copy
of the program.</sent>
</p>

<p id="gsfdl.preamble.p5">
 <sent id="gsfdl.preamble.p5.s1">Users must be free to modify the manual's
technical content as they see fit.</sent> <sent
id="gsfdl.preamble.p5.s2">When they modify the program, adding or changing
features, it is conscientious to update the manual too---so the
manual's license must permit this.</sent> <sent
id="gsfdl.preamble.p5.s3">However, it is legitimate to have requirements for
giving credit to previous contributors, and license terms and
philosophical statements such as this preamble may be
invariant.</sent>

<p id="gsfdl.preamble.p6">
 <sent id="gsfdl.preamble.p6.s1">This License is a kind of "copyleft", which

General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free
software.</sent>
</p>

<p id="gsfdl.preamble.p7">
 <sent id="gsfdl.preamble.p7.s1">We have designed this License in order to
use it for manuals for free software, but it is not limited to
software manuals; it can be used for any primarily textual work,
regardless of subject matter and regardless of whether it is published
as a printed book.</sent> <sent id="gsfdl.preamble.p7.s2">We recommend this
License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or
reference.</sent>

language.</sent>

 <sent id="gsfdl.applic.defs.p3.s1">A "Transparent" copy of the Document means
a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification
is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the
document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images
composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some
widely available drawing editor or (for software-generated plots)
being run to reproduce the plot, and that is suitable for input to
text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats
suitable for input to text formatters.</sent> <sent

format in a way that thwarts or discourages subsequent substantial
modification by others is not Transparent.</sent> <sent

"Opaque".</sent>

 <sent id="gsfdl.applic.defs.p4.s1">Examples of suitable formats for
Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input
format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available
DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed
for human modification.</sent> <sent id="gsfdl.applic.defs.p4.s2">Examples of
transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.</sent> <sent
id="gsfdl.applic.defs.p4.s3">Opaque formats include proprietary formats that
can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced
by some word processors for output purposes only.</sent>

<p id="gsfdl.applic.defs.p5">
 <sent id="gsfdl.applic.defs.p5.s1">The "Title Page" means, for a printed book,
the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to
hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the
title page.</sent> <sent id="gsfdl.applic.defs.p5.s2">For works in formats
which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means the text
near the most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the
beginning of the body of the text.</sent>
</p>

<p id="gsfdl.applic.defs.p6">
 <sent id="gsfdl.applic.defs.p6.s1">A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named
subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or
contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in
another language.</sent> <sent id="gsfdl.applic.defs.p6.s2">(Here XYZ stands
for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
"Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or
"History".)</sent> <sent id="gsfdl.applic.defs.p6.s3">To "Preserve the Title"
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
