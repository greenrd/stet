Thank you for sending your comments on the GPLv3 draft.
Unfortunately, we were unable to find the text:
"{$msg->header->{'subject'}}"
in the license draft.  Messages sent to <comments@gplv3.fsf.org> are
processed automatically and are not seen by human eyes until they are
entered in the comment system.  All comments in the commenting system
must be attached to a specific string of text (within a single
sentence) from the current draft under discussion.

Please note that, as described at
http://gplv3.fsf.org/comments/email.html, 

- Your should have registered at https://www.fsf.org/register_form, and
  sent your message from the address you gave when registering;

- the Subject: line of your message should be the specific draft text
  that your comment is addressing;

- the first line of your message should be a brief, one-line
  subject/summary of your comment, followed by a blank line;

- the rest of your message will be entered as the text of your
  comment.

Multiple comments on separate sections of the text should be sent in
separate emails.

If you have found a bug in the web or email interfaces, please send
all useful information to tech@gplv3.fsf.org, where they will be
entered in our bug tracker.

(This is the first run of the email interface, which will soon be
automated, so now would be a particularly good time to point out bugs.)
