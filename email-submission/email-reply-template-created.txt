If you did not submit this comment, please let us (tech@gplv3.fsf.org)
know: there is only so much we can do to verify the identity of the
sender, so there's a chance someone emailed it pretending to be you.

Messages sent to <comments@gplv3.fsf.org> are processed automatically
and are not seen by human eyes until they are entered in the comment
system.

If you have found a bug in the web or email interfaces, please send
all useful information to <tech@gplv3.fsf.org>, where they will be
entered in our bug tracker.

(This is an early, batch run of the email interface, which will soon
be entirely automatic.  So now would be a particularly good time to
point out bugs.)
