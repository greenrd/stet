<h3>Emailing your comments</h3>

<p>The GPLv3 comment system is actively being developed, and its
browser compatibility is currently limited.  In order to make the
commenting process immediately accessible to everyone, we also welcome
comment submissions by email.  Comments sent by email will be
aggregated and processed in the same system as all the other comments,
and will be read and acted on indistinguishably from web-submitted comments.
</p>

<p><span style="color:red; font-weight:bold">New:</span> Please be sure you have <a
href="https://www.fsf.org/register_form">registered</a>, and send your
message from the same email address you gave when registering</p>

<p>Email submissions will be parsed and processed automatically, and
in order for your comments to be associated with the relevant portions
of the text, please send your messages in the following format:
</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>From:</strong> <em>[Send your message from the same account you used to register at fsf.org]</em><br/>
<strong>Subject:</strong> <em>[The string of contiguous draft text that you wish to comment on]</em><br/>
<br/>
<strong>[Body]</strong> <em>[One line summarizing your comment]</em><br>&nbsp;<br>
<em>[at least one blank line]</em><br>
<em>The body of your comment regarding text in your subject line.</em>
</blockquote>

<p>
You will not receive a reply right away, nor will your comment show up
on the main site immediately: emailed comments will initially be
processed in a batch.  But you will be notified when your comment has
been processed, or in the event that your message could not be parsed
into a usable annotation.
</p>
<p>Send your comments to: <a href="mailto:comments@gplv3.fsf.org">comments at gplv3.fsf.org</a></p>
