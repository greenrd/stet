X-Precedence: bulk

Thank you for sending your comments on the GPLv3 draft to
comments@gplv3.fsf.org.  Unfortunately, there was some ambiguity in
what you sent us: 

The text in the subject line of your email: 
"{$msg->header->{'subject'}}"
occurs more than once in the text of the license draft.  Please
include more words from the text you are commenting on (maybe add a
word or two on each end of what you've already chosen), to help us
narrow down which specific part of the license text you're referring
to, and resubmit the comment.

General notes:

Messages sent to <comments@gplv3.fsf.org> are processed automatically
and are not seen by human eyes until they are entered in the comment
system.  All comments in the commenting system must be attached to a
specific string of text (within a single sentence) from the current
draft under discussion

Please note that, as described at
http://gplv3.fsf.org/comments/email.html, 

- You should have registered at https://www.fsf.org/register_form, and
  send your emails from the same address you gave when registering;

- the Subject: line of your message should be the specific draft text
  that your comment is addressing;

- the first line of your message should be a brief, one-line
  subject/summary of your comment, followed by a blank line;

- the rest of your message will be entered as the text of your
  comment.

Multiple comments on separate sections of the text should be sent in
separate emails.

If you have found a bug in the web or email interfaces, please send
all useful information to tech@gplv3.fsf.org, where they will be
entered in our bug tracker.
