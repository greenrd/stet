This is an entirely preliminary, undocumented, unsupported release of
stet.  Files may be missing.  Scatology may be unexpurgated.  I don't
have much time to help you with this right now.  You need RT; we're
using version 3.2.  There are perl dependencies.  There are unstated
assumptions.  But you asked for it.  You got it.

It is highly recommended that you run this through mod_gzip, and that
you gzip all js and css as well as any html that comes through Mason.

General information:

(The name of this package should always be written all-lowercase.)

The system is named "stet", after the proofreader's mark meaning "let
it stand as it is".  Stet is collaborative document revision system,
getting its users and commenters to the point where they can say "let
it stand as it is" about the whole document.
