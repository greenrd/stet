This is an entirely preliminary, undocumented, unsupported release of
stet.  Files may be missing.  Scatology may be unexpurgated.  I don't
have much time to help you with this right now.  You need RT; we're
using version 3.2.  There are perl dependencies.  There are unstated
assumptions.  And the whole thing is made of dry spaghetti.

But you asked for it.  You got it.

(The name of this package should always be written all-lowercase.)

The system is named "stet", after the proofreader's mark meaning "let
it stand as it is".  Stet is collaborative document revision system,
getting its users and commenters to the point where they can say "let
it stand as it is" about the whole document.
