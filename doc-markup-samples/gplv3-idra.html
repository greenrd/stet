General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if
you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in
new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.  </sent></p>
<p id="gpl3.preamble.p2" name="gpl3.preamble.p2"><sent id="gpl3.preamble.p2.s1" name="gpl3.preamble.p2.s1">To protect your rights, we need to make
requirements that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you
to surrender the rights.  </sent><sent id="gpl3.preamble.p2.s2" name="gpl3.preamble.p2.s2">These
restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you

your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and

this free software.  </sent><sent id="gpl3.preamble.p5.s2" name="gpl3.preamble.p5.s2">If the software
is modified by someone else and passed on, the GPL ensures that
recipients are told that what they have is not the original, so that
any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.  </sent></p>
<p id="gpl3.preamble.p6" name="gpl3.preamble.p6"><sent id="gpl3.preamble.p6.s1" name="gpl3.preamble.p6.s1">Some countries have adopted laws prohibiting software that enables users
to escape from Digital Restrictions Management.  </sent><sent id="gpl3.preamble.p6.s2" name="gpl3.preamble.p6.s2">DRM is fundamentally
incompatible with the purpose of the GPL, which is to protect users'
freedom; therefore, the GPL ensures that the software it covers will
neither be subject to, nor subject other works to, digital restrictions
from which escape is forbidden.  </sent></p>

individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
proprietary.  </sent><sent id="gpl3.preamble.p7.s3" name="gpl3.preamble.p7.s3">To prevent this, the GPL makes it clear that any patent must
