the publishers or authors of the Work to the Work's overall subject
(or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly
within that overall subject.  </span><span id="gfdl.applicdef.p2.s2" name="gfdl.applicdef.p2.s2">(Thus, if the Work is in part a textbook

represented in a format whose specification is available to the

generic editors appropriate to the medium (text, sound, video, etc.),
and that is suitable (perhaps through programmed format conversion) for
input to a wide variety of programs for processing that medium.  </span><span id="gfdl.applicdef.p5.s2" name="gfdl.applicdef.p5.s2">Material stored in an otherwise Transparent file format in a way that

proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary

of such a section when you modify the Work means that it remains a
