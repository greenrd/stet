cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.  </span></p>
<p id="agplv3.preamble.p1" name="agplv3.preamble.p1"><span id="agplv3.preamble.p1.s1" name="agplv3.preamble.p1.s1">The licenses for most software and other practical works are

contrast, our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your

have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for

want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.  </span></p>

you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute

receive widespread use, become available for other developers to
incorporate.  </span><span id="agplv3.preamble.p4.s2" name="agplv3.preamble.p4.s2">Many developers of free software are heartened and
encouraged by the resulting cooperation.  </span><span id="agplv3.preamble.p4.s3" name="agplv3.preamble.p4.s3">However, in the case of
software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about.  </span><span id="agplv3.preamble.p4.s4" name="agplv3.preamble.p4.s4">The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and
letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its

provide the source code of the modified version running there to the
users of that server.  </span><span id="agplv3.preamble.p5.s3" name="agplv3.preamble.p5.s3">Therefore, public use of a modified version, on

Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  </span><span id="agplv3.sourcecode.p2.s2" name="agplv3.sourcecode.p2.s2">A
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component

System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free

which are not part of the work.  </span><span id="agplv3.sourcecode.p3.s3" name="agplv3.sourcecode.p3.s3">For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
