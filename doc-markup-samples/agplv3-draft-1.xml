<title>Preamble</title>
<p id="agplv3.preamble.p0">
 <sent id="agplv3.preamble.p0.s1">The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license
for software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure
cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.</sent>
</p>

<p id="agplv3.preamble.p1">
 <sent id="agplv3.preamble.p1.s1">The licenses for most software and other practical works are
designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works.</sent>
 <sent id="agplv3.preamble.p1.s2">By
contrast, our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your
freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it
remains free software for all its users.</sent>
</p>

<p id="agplv3.preamble.p2">
 <sent id="agplv3.preamble.p2.s1">When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.</sent>
 <sent id="agplv3.preamble.p2.s2">Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.</sent>
</p>

<p id="agplv3.preamble.p3">
 <sent id="agplv3.preamble.p3.s1">Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights
with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer
you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
and/or modify the software.</sent>
</p>

<p id="agplv3.preamble.p4">
 <sent id="agplv3.preamble.p4.s1">A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that
improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they
receive widespread use, become available for other developers to
incorporate.</sent>
 <sent id="agplv3.preamble.p4.s2">Many developers of free software are heartened and
encouraged by the resulting cooperation.</sent>
 <sent id="agplv3.preamble.p4.s3">However, in the case of
software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about.</sent>
 <sent id="agplv3.preamble.p4.s4">The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and
letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its
source code to the public.</sent>
</p>

<p id="agplv3.preamble.p5">
 <sent id="agplv3.preamble.p5.s1">The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to
ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available
to the community.</sent>
 <sent id="agplv3.preamble.p5.s2">It requires the operator of a network server to
provide the source code of the modified version running there to the
users of that server.</sent>
 <sent id="agplv3.preamble.p5.s3">Therefore, public use of a modified version, on
a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source
code of the modified version.</sent>

"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.</sent>
</p>

<p id="agplv3.definitions.p2">
 <sent id="agplv3.definitions.p2.s1">To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the
work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the
making of an exact copy.</sent>
 <sent id="agplv3.definitions.p2.s2">The resulting work is called a "modified
version" of the earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.</sent>
 <sent id="agplv3.definitions.p2.s3">A
"covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on
the Program.</sent>
</p>

<p id="agplv3.definitions.p3">
 <sent id="agplv3.definitions.p3.s1">To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or making modifications that you do not share.</sent>
 <sent id="agplv3.definitions.p3.s2">Propagation
includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making
available to the public, and in some countries other activities as
well.</sent>
 <sent id="agplv3.definitions.p3.s3">To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables
other parties to make or receive copies, excluding sublicensing.</sent>
 <sent id="agplv3.definitions.p3.s4">Mere
interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer
of a copy, is not conveying.</sent>
</p>

<p id="agplv3.definitions.p4">
 <sent id="agplv3.definitions.p4.s1">An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.</sent>
 <sent id="agplv3.definitions.p4.s2">If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.</sent>

<title>1. Source Code.</title>
<p id="agplv3.sourcecode.p0">
 <sent id="agplv3.sourcecode.p0.s1">The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it.</sent>
 <sent id="agplv3.sourcecode.p0.s2">"Object code" means any non-source
form of a work.</sent>
</p>

<p id="agplv3.sourcecode.p1">
 <sent id="agplv3.sourcecode.p1.s1">A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.</sent>
</p>

<p id="agplv3.sourcecode.p2">
 <sent id="agplv3.sourcecode.p2.s1">The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form.</sent>
 <sent id="agplv3.sourcecode.p2.s2">A
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.</sent>
</p>

<p id="agplv3.sourcecode.p3">
 <sent id="agplv3.sourcecode.p3.s1">The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities.</sent>
 <sent id="agplv3.sourcecode.p3.s2">However, it does not include the work's
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work.</sent>
 <sent id="agplv3.sourcecode.p3.s3">For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.</sent>
</p>

<p id="agplv3.sourcecode.p4">
 <sent id="agplv3.sourcecode.p4.s1">The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
Source.</sent>
</p>

<p id="agplv3.sourcecode.p5">
 <sent id="agplv3.sourcecode.p5.s1">The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
same work.</sent>

modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
