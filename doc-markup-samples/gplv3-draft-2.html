<p id="gpl3.preamble.p0" name="gpl3.preamble.p0"><span id="gpl3.preamble.p0.s1" name="gpl3.preamble.p0.s1">The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
share and change it.  </span><span id="gpl3.preamble.p0.s2" name="gpl3.preamble.p0.s2">By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
make sure the software is free for all its users.  </span><span id="gpl3.preamble.p0.s3" name="gpl3.preamble.p0.s3">We, the Free Software
Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it
applies also to any other program whose authors commit to using it.  </span><span id="gpl3.preamble.p0.s4" name="gpl3.preamble.p0.s4">You
can apply it to your programs, too.  </span></p>
<p id="gpl3.preamble.p1" name="gpl3.preamble.p1"><span id="gpl3.preamble.p1.s1" name="gpl3.preamble.p1.s1">When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  </span><span id="gpl3.preamble.p1.s2" name="gpl3.preamble.p1.s2">Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.  </span></p>
<p id="gpl3.preamble.p2" name="gpl3.preamble.p2"><span id="gpl3.preamble.p2.s1" name="gpl3.preamble.p2.s1">To protect your rights, we need to make requirements that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.  </span><span id="gpl3.preamble.p2.s2" name="gpl3.preamble.p2.s2">Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies
of the software, or if you modify it.  </span></p>
<p id="gpl3.preamble.p3" name="gpl3.preamble.p3"><span id="gpl3.preamble.p3.s1" name="gpl3.preamble.p3.s1">For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  </span><span id="gpl3.preamble.p3.s2" name="gpl3.preamble.p3.s2">You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  </span><span id="gpl3.preamble.p3.s3" name="gpl3.preamble.p3.s3">And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.  </span></p>
<p id="gpl3.preamble.p4" name="gpl3.preamble.p4"><span id="gpl3.preamble.p4.s1" name="gpl3.preamble.p4.s1">Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the
software.  </span></p>
<p id="gpl3.preamble.p5" name="gpl3.preamble.p5"><span id="gpl3.preamble.p5.s1" name="gpl3.preamble.p5.s1">For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly
explains that there is no warranty for this free software.  </span><span id="gpl3.preamble.p5.s2" name="gpl3.preamble.p5.s2">For both
users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be
marked as changed, so that their problems will not be associated
erroneously with the original version.  </span></p>
<p id="gpl3.preamble.p6" name="gpl3.preamble.p6"><span id="gpl3.preamble.p6.s1" name="gpl3.preamble.p6.s1">Some computers are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them.  </span><span id="gpl3.preamble.p6.s2" name="gpl3.preamble.p6.s2">This is fundamentally
incompatible with the purpose of the GPL, which is to protect users'
freedom to change the software.  </span><span id="gpl3.preamble.p6.s3" name="gpl3.preamble.p6.s3">Therefore, the GPL ensures that the
software it covers will not be restricted in this way.  </span></p>
<p id="gpl3.preamble.p7" name="gpl3.preamble.p7"><span id="gpl3.preamble.p7.s1" name="gpl3.preamble.p7.s1">Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.  </span><span id="gpl3.preamble.p7.s2" name="gpl3.preamble.p7.s2">States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in places where they do, we
wish to avoid the special danger that redistributors of a free program
will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
proprietary.  </span><span id="gpl3.preamble.p7.s3" name="gpl3.preamble.p7.s3">To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be
used to render the program non-free.  </span></p>

means any modified version, formation of which requires permission

<p id="gpl3.definitions.p1" name="gpl3.definitions.p1"><span id="gpl3.definitions.p1.s1" name="gpl3.definitions.p1.s1">To "propagate" a work means doing anything with it that requires
permission under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer, or making modifications that you do not share.  </span><span id="gpl3.definitions.p1.s2" name="gpl3.definitions.p1.s2">Propagation
includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making
available to the public, and in some countries other activities as
well.  </span><span id="gpl3.definitions.p1.s3" name="gpl3.definitions.p1.s3">To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables

<p id="gpl3.sourcecode.p1" name="gpl3.sourcecode.p1"><span id="gpl3.sourcecode.p1.s1" name="gpl3.sourcecode.p1.s1">The "System Libraries" of an executable work include every subunit
such that (a) the identical subunit is normally included as an adjunct
in the distribution of either a major essential component (kernel,
window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on
which the object code runs, or a compiler used to produce the object
code, or an object code interpreter used to run it, and (b) the
subunit (aside from possible incidental extensions) serves only to
enable use of the work with that system component or compiler or
interpreter, or to implement a widely used or standard interface for
which an implementation is available to the public in source code
form.  </span></p>
<p id="gpl3.sourcecode.p2" name="gpl3.sourcecode.p2"><span id="gpl3.sourcecode.p2.s1" name="gpl3.sourcecode.p2.s1">The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, except its System
Libraries, and except general-purpose tools or generally available
free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities
but which are not part of the work.  </span><span id="gpl3.sourcecode.p2.s2" name="gpl3.sourcecode.p2.s2">For example, Corresponding Source
includes scripts used to control those activities, interface
definition files associated with the program source files, and the
source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms
that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by complex
data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other
parts of the work.  </span></p>
<p id="gpl3.sourcecode.p3" name="gpl3.sourcecode.p3"><span id="gpl3.sourcecode.p3.s1" name="gpl3.sourcecode.p3.s1">The Corresponding Source also includes any encryption or
authorization keys necessary to install and/or execute modified
versions from source code in the recommended or principal context of
use, such that they can implement all the same functionality in the
same range of circumstances.  </span><span id="gpl3.sourcecode.p3.s2" name="gpl3.sourcecode.p3.s2">(For instance, if the work is a DVD
player and can play certain DVDs, it must be possible for modified
versions to play those DVDs.  </span><span id="gpl3.sourcecode.p3.s3" name="gpl3.sourcecode.p3.s3">If the work communicates with an online
service, it must be possible for modified versions to communicate with
the same online service in the same way such that the service cannot
distinguish.)  </span><span id="gpl3.sourcecode.p3.s4" name="gpl3.sourcecode.p3.s4">A key need not be included in cases where use of the
work normally implies the user already has the key and can read and
copy it, as in privacy applications where users generate their own
keys.  </span><span id="gpl3.sourcecode.p3.s5" name="gpl3.sourcecode.p3.s5">However, the fact that a key is generated based on the object
code of the work or is present in hardware that limits its use does
not alter the requirement to include it in the Corresponding Source.  </span></p>
<p id="gpl3.sourcecode.p4" name="gpl3.sourcecode.p4"><span id="gpl3.sourcecode.p4.s1" name="gpl3.sourcecode.p4.s1">The Corresponding Source may include portions which do not formally
state this License as their license, but qualify under section 7
for inclusion in a work under this License.  </span></p>
