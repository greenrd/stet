<p class="sectTitle sub" id="gpl3.preamble.0.0.0"><span id="gpl3.preamble.0.0.0.0"></span></p>
<p id="gpl3.preamble.p0"><span id="gpl3.preamble.p0.s1">The licenses for most software are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change it.  </span><span id="gpl3.preamble.p0.s2">By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  </span><span id="gpl3.preamble.p0.s3">We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU
General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other program whose authors commit to using it.  </span><span id="gpl3.preamble.p0.s4">(Some Free Software Foundation software is covered
by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  </span><span id="gpl3.preamble.p0.s5">You can apply it to your programs, too.  </span></p>
<p id="gpl3.preamble.p1"><span id="gpl3.preamble.p1.s1">When we speak of free software, we are
referring to freedom, not price.  </span><span id="gpl3.preamble.p1.s2">Our
General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if
you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in
new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.  </span></p>
<p id="gpl3.preamble.p2"><span id="gpl3.preamble.p2.s1">To protect your rights, we need to make
requirements that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you
to surrender the rights.  </span><span id="gpl3.preamble.p2.s2">These
restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.  </span></p>
<p id="gpl3.preamble.p3"><span id="gpl3.preamble.p3.s1">For example, if you distribute copies of
such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the
recipients all the rights that you have.  </span><span id="gpl3.preamble.p3.s2">You must make sure that they, too, receive or can
get the source code.  </span><span id="gpl3.preamble.p3.s3">And you must
show them these terms so they know their rights.  </span></p>
<p id="gpl3.preamble.p4"><span id="gpl3.preamble.p4.s1">Developers that use the GNU GPL protect
your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and
(2) offer you this License which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.  </span></p>
<p id="gpl3.preamble.p5"><span id="gpl3.preamble.p5.s1">For the developers' and author's
protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for
this free software.  </span><span id="gpl3.preamble.p5.s2">If the software
is modified by someone else and passed on, the GPL ensures that
recipients are told that what they have is not the original, so that
any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.  </span></p>
<p id="gpl3.preamble.p6"><span id="gpl3.preamble.p6.s1">Some countries have adopted laws prohibiting software that enables users
to escape from Digital Restrictions Management.  </span><span id="gpl3.preamble.p6.s2">DRM is fundamentally
incompatible with the purpose of the GPL, which is to protect users'
freedom; therefore, the GPL ensures that the software it covers will
neither be subject to, nor subject other works to, digital restrictions
from which escape is forbidden.  </span></p>
<p id="gpl3.preamble.p7"><span id="gpl3.preamble.p7.s1">Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.  </span><span id="gpl3.preamble.p7.s2">We
wish to avoid the special danger that redistributors of a free program will
individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
proprietary.  </span><span id="gpl3.preamble.p7.s3">To prevent this, the GPL makes it clear that any patent must
be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.  </span></p>
<p id="gpl3.preamble.p8"><span id="gpl3.preamble.p8.s1">The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.  </span></p></div><div id="gpl3.termsheader"><p class="sectTitle" id="gpl3.termsheader.0"><span id="gpl3.termsheader.0.0">GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</span></p>

this License.  </span><span id="gpl3.definitions.p0.s2">The "Program" refers to any such program or work, and a
"work based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work
under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a
portion of it, either modified or unmodified.  </span><span id="gpl3.definitions.p0.s3">Throughout this License, the
term "modification" includes, without limitation, translation and
extension.  </span><span id="gpl3.definitions.p0.s4">A "covered work" means either the Program or any work based on
the Program.  </span><span id="gpl3.definitions.p0.s5">Each licensee is addressed as "you".  </span></p>
<p id="gpl3.definitions.p1"><span id="gpl3.definitions.p1.s1">To "propagate" a work means doing anything with it that requires
permission under applicable copyright law, other than executing it on
a computer or making private modifications.  </span><span id="gpl3.definitions.p1.s2">This includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), sublicensing, and in some
countries other activities as well.  </span></p></div><div id="gpl3.sourcecode"><p class="sectTitle" id="gpl3.sourcecode.0"><span id="gpl3.sourcecode.0.0">1. Source Code</span></p>

for making modifications to it.  </span><span id="gpl3.sourcecode.p0.s2">"Object code" means any non-source
version of a work.  </span></p>
<p id="gpl3.sourcecode.p1"><span id="gpl3.sourcecode.p1.s1">The "Complete Corresponding Source Code" for a work in object code form
means all the source code needed to understand, adapt, modify, compile,
link, install, and run the work, excluding general-purpose tools used in
performing those activities but which are not part of the work.  </span><span id="gpl3.sourcecode.p1.s2">For
example, this includes any scripts used to control those activities, and
any shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is
designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow
between those subprograms and other parts of the work, and interface
definition files associated with the program source files.  </span></p>
<p id="gpl3.sourcecode.p2"><span id="gpl3.sourcecode.p2.s1">Complete Corresponding Source Code also includes any encryption or
authorization codes necessary to install and/or execute the source code of
the work, perhaps modified by you, in the recommended or principal context
of use, such that its functioning in all circumstances is identical to that
of the work, except as altered by your modifications.  </span><span id="gpl3.sourcecode.p2.s2">It also includes any
decryption codes necessary to access or unseal the work's output.  </span><span id="gpl3.sourcecode.p2.s3">Notwithstanding this, a code need not be included in cases where use of the
work normally implies the user already has it.  </span></p>
<p id="gpl3.sourcecode.p3"><span id="gpl3.sourcecode.p3.s1">Complete Corresponding Source Code need not include anything that users
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Complete Corresponding
Source Code.  </span></p>
<p id="gpl3.sourcecode.p4"><span id="gpl3.sourcecode.p4.s1">As a special exception, the Complete Corresponding Source Code need not include a
particular subunit if (a) the identical subunit is normally included
as an adjunct in the distribution of either a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the operating system on which the
executable runs or a compiler used to produce the executable or an object
code interpreter used to run it, and (b) the subunit (aside from possible
incidental extensions) serves only to enable use of the work with that
system component or compiler or interpreter, or to implement a widely used
or standard interface, the implemention of which requires no patent license
not already generally available for software under this License.  </span></p></div><div id="basicperms"><p class="sectTitle" id="basicperms.0"><span id="basicperms.0.0">2. Basic Permissions</span></p>

copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  </span><span id="gpl3.basicperms.p0.s2">This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the Program.  </span><span id="gpl3.basicperms.p0.s3">The output from running it is covered by
this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a work
based on the Program.  </span><span id="gpl3.basicperms.p0.s4">This License acknowledges your rights of "fair use"
or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.  </span></p>
<p id="gpl3.basicperms.p1"><span id="gpl3.basicperms.p1.s1">This License gives unlimited permission to privately modify and run the

anyone for making, using or distributing their own works based on the
Program.  </span></p>
<p id="gpl3.basicperms.p2"><span id="gpl3.basicperms.p2.s1">Propagation of covered works is permitted without limitation provided it
does not enable parties other than you to make or receive copies.  </span><span id="gpl3.basicperms.p2.s2">Propagation which does enable them to do so is permitted, as
"distribution", under the conditions of sections 4-6 below.  </span></p></div><div id="gpl3.drm"><p class="sectTitle" id="gpl3.drm.0"><span id="gpl3.drm.0.0">3. Digital Restrictions Management</span></p>

<p id="gpl3.drm.p0"><span id="gpl3.drm.p0.s1">As a free software license, this License intrinsically disfavors
technical attempts to restrict users' freedom to copy, modify, and share
copyrighted works.  </span><span id="gpl3.drm.p0.s2">Each of its provisions shall be interpreted in light of
this specific declaration of the licensor's intent.  </span><span id="gpl3.drm.p0.s3">Regardless of any
other provision of this license, no permission is given to distribute
covered works that illegally invade users' privacy, nor for modes of
distribution that deny users that run covered works the full exercise of
the legal rights granted by this License.  </span></p>
<p id="gpl3.drm.p1"><span id="gpl3.drm.p1.s1">No covered work constitutes part of an effective technological protection
measure: that is to say, distribution of a covered work as part of a system
to generate or access certain data constitutes general permission at least
for development, distribution and use, under this License, of other
software capable of accessing the same data.  </span></p></div><div id="verbatimcopying"><p class="sectTitle" id="verbatimcopying.0"><span id="verbatimcopying.0.0">4.[1] Verbatim Copying.</span></p>

appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all license notices and notices of the
absence of any warranty; give all recipients of the Program a copy of this
License along with the Program; and obey any additional terms present on
parts of the Program in accord with section 7.  </span></p>

<p id="gpl3.distribmod.p0"><span id="gpl3.distribmod.p0.s1">Having modified a copy of the Program under the conditions of section
2, thus forming a work based on the Program, you may copy and distribute
such modifications or work in the form of source code under the terms of
Section 4 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:  </span></p>
<p id="gpl3.distribmod.p1"><span id="gpl3.distribmod.p1.s1">a) The modified work must carry prominent notices stating that you
    changed the work and the date of any change.  </span></p>
<p id="gpl3.distribmod.p2"><span id="gpl3.distribmod.p2.s1">b) You must license the entire modified work, as a whole,

    License must apply, unmodified except as permitted by section 7 below,
    to the whole of the work.  </span><span id="gpl3.distribmod.p2.s3">This License gives no permission to license
    the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission
    if you have separately received it.  </span></p>
<p id="gpl3.distribmod.p3"><span id="gpl3.distribmod.p3.s1">c) If the modified work has interactive user interfaces, each must
    include a convenient feature that displays an appropriate copyright
    notice, and tells the user that there is no warranty for the program
    (or that you provide a warranty), that users may redistribute the
    program under these conditions, and how to view a copy of this License together with the central list (if any) of other terms in accord with section 7.  </span><span id="gpl3.distribmod.p3.s2">If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
    menu, a command to display this information must be prominent in the
    list.  </span><span id="gpl3.distribmod.p3.s3">Otherwise, the modified work must display this information at
    startup--except in the case that the Program has such interactive
    modes and does not display this information at startup.  </span></p>
<p id="gpl3.distribmod.p4"><span id="gpl3.distribmod.p4.s1">These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  </span><span id="gpl3.distribmod.p4.s2">If identifiable
sections of that work, added by you, are not derived from the Program, and
can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves,
then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you
distribute them as separate works for use not in combination with the
Program.  </span><span id="gpl3.distribmod.p4.s3">But when you distribute the same sections for use in combination
with covered works, no matter in what form such combination occurs, the
whole of the combination must be licensed under this License, whose
permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to
every part of the whole.  </span><span id="gpl3.distribmod.p4.s4">Your sections may carry other terms as part
of this combination in limited ways, described in section 7.  </span></p>
<p id="gpl3.distribmod.p5"><span id="gpl3.distribmod.p5.s1">Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.  </span></p>
<p id="gpl3.distribmod.p6"><span id="gpl3.distribmod.p6.s1">A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered
work, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
"aggregate" if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to
limit the legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the
individual works permit.  </span><span id="gpl3.distribmod.p6.s2">Mere inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate
