      <p>If distribution of executable or object code is made by

	  License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy
	  simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other
	  pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
	  distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license
	  would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
	  all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,
	  then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License
	  would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

      <p>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to

	purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software

	practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the
	wide range of software distributed through that system in
	reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
	the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to
	distribute software through any other system and a licensee

    <title>How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</title>

    <p>
      If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the
      greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve
      this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute
      and change under these terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is
      safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most
      effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file
      should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where
      the full notice is found.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what
      it does.&gt; Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt; &lt;name of author&gt;
    </p>
    <p>
      This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
      modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as
      published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of
      the License, or (at your option) any later version.
    </p>
    <p>
      This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
      but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
      MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
      GNU General Public License for more details.
    </p>
    <p>
      You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public
      License along with this program; if not, write to the Free
      Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor,
      Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA
    </p>
    <p>
      Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and
      paper mail.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice
      like this when it starts in an interactive mode:
    </p>
    <p>
      Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
      Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type
      `show w'.  This is free software, and you are welcome to
      redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c' for
      details.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
      appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the
      commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and
      `show c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu
      items--whatever suits your program.
    </p>
    <p>
      You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer)
      or your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the
      program, if necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
    </p>
    <p>
      Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
      program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written
      by James Hacker.

    <p>
      This General Public License does not permit incorporating your
      program into proprietary programs.  If your program is a
      subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit
      linking proprietary applications with the library.  If this is
      what you want to do, use the GNU Library General Public License
      instead of this License.
