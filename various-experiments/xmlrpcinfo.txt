There are now two new users in the gplv3-launch zope instance which are
allowed to use the XMLRPC functions. Here's the specifics:

For pre-launch, the listener is:

http://user:pass@gplv3.fsf.org:8800/launch/acl_users/Users/acl_users

Authenticator info:

stet_auth	PASSWORD
mw_auth		PASSWORD

In production, the path will most likely be:

http://user:pass@gplv3.fsf.org/acl_users/Users/acl_users

but this depends on what rewriting we do, and if you connect directly to
Zope or not, yadda yadda.
