	Major revision, changing highlighting system to color things more
	intensely if they have more comments.  This release contains both
	the current version (gplv3-draft-1.html) and the "classic"
	version (classic.html) the comment system.  Most of the
	improvements take place in stet-intense-shorter.js, but there is
	also a bit of action in the revised xmlresults-intense.html, since
	xmlresults.html has passed some of its functionality to
	getannotation.html.
